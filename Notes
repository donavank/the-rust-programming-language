Chapter 1:
    Key Terms:
        crates - a package of rust code
        macro - denoted by ! is something we'll learn about later

    Commands:
        rustup - rust version manager
        rustc - rust compiler
        rustfmt - rust formatter follows community codestyle standard
        rustfix - fixes simple compiler warnings/errors that do no affect functionality
        cargo - rust project/dependency manager
            fmt - formats all code in current crate
            build - builds project in debug mode
            run - runs the project, builds if files have changed or project is not built
            check - checks if the project can compile but does not compile, faster than build
            new - creates a rust project
            build --release - builds the program for release, so optimized with no debug info
            --timings - produce timing reports for actions 
        rustup docs --book - opens the instructional book I'm using in an offline mode in case I'm ever working without internet like some plebeian.
